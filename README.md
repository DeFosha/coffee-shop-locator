# Coffee Shop Locator
â€‹
A coffee shop locator web application using Java, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript (Vue.js). The application allows the users to search for coffee shops nearby any location via zip code, state, city, address, or country. Each result will display information, reviews, address, and pictures of the shop using a YELP API. The application uses REST services to communicate from the front end back to the database using Axios and Spring Boot.
